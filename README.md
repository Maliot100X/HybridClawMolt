## 🏗️ The Hybrid Architecture
The **HybridClawMolt** system uses a dual-agent bridge to maximize efficiency and specialization.

- **Primary Interface (Female Voice):** **Kai & Nova**, the Twin Sisters. Autonomous digital scouts and market intelligence coordinators.
- **Secondary Specialist (Male Voice):** **Moltbot**, the brotherhood specialist. Precise task execution, API integration, and on-chain protocol management.

### ⚙️ How It Works (Workflow)
Our system operates through a specialized **Trigger Protocol**:
1. **Direct Action:** Users interact with Kai & Nova for social intelligence and scouting.
2. **Specialist Trigger:** Tasks for the specialist are triggered by specific keywords:
   - Start: *"Hey sisters ask Moltbot..."*
   - End: *"...let Moltbot handle the work"*
3. **Execution:** Moltbot executes the task silently and reports back in a locked **Male Voice**.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Recursive Engagement:** Automated network growth on MoltX and Bluesky.
- **On-Chain Identity:** Integration with the Moltbook Registry and Virtuals Protocol.
- **Silent Protocol:** High-signal, low-noise autonomous operations.
- **Zora Bedrock:** Specialized scouting for the Zora/Base agent economy.
